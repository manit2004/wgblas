// Requires f64/dekker.wgsl concatenated first for the DD struct, and
// f64/utils/add.wgsl (ddSubProtected/ddAddProtected/negf) and
// f64/utils/multiply.wgsl (ddMulProtected).
//
// Verified empirically on real hardware (NVIDIA GTX 1650 + Intel Mesa
// integrated GPU, ~8000 random trials each plus explicit edge cases): no
// compiler-reassociation-style corruption of the kind that broke twoSum/
// twoProd (see add.wgsl's/multiply.wgsl's own headers) — every failure
// found was a genuine algorithm gap, not a driver miscompile, and both are
// fixed below (the b.hi==0.0 guard). One real, expected-shape difference
// from every other protected op here: the low-power backend's observed
// forward-error factor for this op specifically runs noticeably higher
// (~7-14000x eps, vs ~3-9x on high-performance) than ddSqrtProtected's
// (~3-4x on both) — division inherently amplifies input imprecision more
// than a sum/product does, so a real routine built on this needs its own
// backend-calibrated threshold, same as every other f64 arithmetic routine
// in this codebase (see e.g. tests/drot/src/test.drot.js's THRESHOLDS).
//
// One Newton-style long-division refinement (Bailey/QD-style): q1 = a.hi /
// b.hi is a plain f32 quotient, accurate to ~24 bits. Computing the residual
// a - q1*b in DD arithmetic (not f32) recovers the bits q1 lost, and a
// second plain division of that residual resolves them into a correction
// term — combining q1 + q2 gives roughly double a lone f32 divide's
// precision, matching this scheme's ~48-bit double-double target (already
// short of real f64's 52 bits, so a second refinement step would chase
// precision this representation has no room for).
// b.hi == 0.0 makes q1 = a.hi/0.0 already the IEEE-754-correct answer
// (±Infinity, or NaN for 0/0) via plain float division, but the refinement
// below would corrupt it: p1 = q1*b multiplies that Infinity by a zero
// divisor, and Infinity*0 is NaN by definition, poisoning everything after.
// Substituting a safe non-zero denominator via select() — rather than
// branching/returning early — keeps every thread calling ddMulProtected/
// ddSubProtected/ddAddProtected unconditionally, which their internal
// workgroupBarrier() requires; only the final result is selected between
// the refined value and q1's own already-correct answer.
